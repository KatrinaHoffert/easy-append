Easy append: simple and fast bulk text additions

    Usage: --prepend [--contains=<regex> [--invert]] <text to add> <files>

The `--prepend` may be replaced by `--append`, which will append text instead of
prepending. There may be any number of these "text additions". The order that
the additions appear is significant as additions will stack with any existing
ones.

Arguments:
----------

These text additions appear as "block" of command line arguments. The order is
significant. The type of addition (prepend or append) must come first, followed
by an optional `--contains` followed by an optional `--invert`. The following
flags can appear in text addition blocks. Only `--prepend` or `--append` is
necesary, and the rest are optional. Note the text that is being added follows
all the flags for the block.

  --prepend   Prepends text to the beginning of files.

  --contains  In the form of `--contains=<regex>`, where regex is a regular
              expression that must be matched in the file to perform the text
              addition. If no match is found, the addition is not performed on
              that file (useful for adding text iff the file does not already
              contain the text).

  --invert    If this flag is present, the regex is inverted and the file must
              *not* contain the regex to have the text addition applied.

The program also has several general options:

  --verbose   Display additional information about the program's process.

  --dry-run   Show what the program would do without any actual side effects.
              If this is on, `--verbose` is implied.

  --help      Displays this text.

When an argument which is not one of these flags is encountered, it is presumed
to be part of the list of files that we're performing text additions on. In
which case, all further arguments will be considered to be files. If you have
files with the same name as a flag, you can symbolize the start of the file list
with `--` (everything after that argument is considered to be a file).

Examples:
---------

To simply add some text to the end of the file without a conditional, we might
use:

    --append "foo" file1.txt file2.txt

Which would append "foo" to the end of file1.txt and file2.txt.

We could also create more complicated rules, like:

    --prepend --contains="^foo$" --invert foo file.txt

Which prepends "foo" to the file if it does not contain the line "foo" already.
